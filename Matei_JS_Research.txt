JS Programs 

1. FItText - http://fittextjs.com/

	This is a jQuery-based plugin that is used often in responsive web
	design. The code adjusts text size based on the viewport window.
	Without it, you would have to write a ton of media queries to adjust
	the text size based on the device that itâ€™s being delivered to. 

	2. SmoothScroll - https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-smooth-scroll

		This is another jQuery-based plugin that is used to animate
		the page scrolling up or down when moving to different points
		on a site. It adds a more modern feel to the website and is a
		fairly simple program. With some research, I think I could
		write something like this. 

		3. TextboxList -
		http://devthought.com/wp-content/projects/mootools/textboxlist/Demo/

			This is a JS program that turns textboxes into a
			widget that enables better visual representations of
			search tags. It looks similar to modern phone designs
			and enables people to remove tags they are searching
			for. It also comes with an autocomplete function. 

			4. jQuery Calendar  -
			http://designmodo.com/demo/calendarjquerycss3/

				This is a fairly simple, but really nice
				looking Android Ice Cream Sandwich-style
				calendar. The CSS handles the look of the
				calendar and the jQuery just enables the class
				for the selected date and removes it from the
				previous selection. 

				5. 	jQuery.Hotkeys -
				https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys

					This jQuery script allows used to
					navigate the menu tree or site with
					their keyboard. This is really great
					for modern presentation style websites
					and I can see this being really useful
					with jQuery custom scroll paths.
